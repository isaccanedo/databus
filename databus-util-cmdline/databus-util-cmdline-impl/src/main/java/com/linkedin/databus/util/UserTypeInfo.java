 * TypeInfo implementation for user-defined column types. A user type is typically comprised of a number of columns
 * of built-in types, basically like a table within a table. We see examples of this in member2, which has an education
 * history type with the name of the institution (VARCHAR2), dates attended (DATE), etc.  Alternatively, a user type
 * can be thought of as a generic table, with top-level database tables as a special case.
