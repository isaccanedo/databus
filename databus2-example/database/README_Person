To setup Person Schema:
   run ./dbreinit_persons.sh
This will setup databus tables with credentials (person/person) using SID "DB"

To load rows, use the loadPersons script:
  Usage: ./loadPersons.sh <username/password[@SID]> <num_records> <start_primary_key> [load|unload]
This will insert some rows to Person table which can be used to test the  propagation of change events in databus relay.
